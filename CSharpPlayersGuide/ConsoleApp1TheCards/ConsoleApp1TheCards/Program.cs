//Each card has a color 
//(red, green, blue, yellow) and a rank (the numbers 1 through 10, followed by the symbols $, %, ^, and &). 
//The third pedestal requires that you create a class to represent a card of this nature.
//192 LEVEL 24 THE CATACOMBS OF THE CLASS
//Objectives:
//• Define enumerations for card colors and card ranks.
//• Define a Card class to represent a card with a color and a rank, as described above.
//• Add properties or methods that tell you if a card is a number or symbol card (the equivalent of a 
//face card).
//• Create a main method that will create a card instance for the whole deck (every color with every 
//rank) and display each (for example, “The Red Ampersand” and “The Blue Seven”).
